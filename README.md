# Bamazon

**About**

Bamazon is an app built with MySQL & Node.js.

This is an Amazon type game where the user from within the terminal can choose from a selection of items. The items are listed by ID number, name, department, cost and inventory. Once a user chooses the item that they want, they will be prompted to select how much of that product they want to buy. If their item is in stock then they will be shown how much to total cost is, If the item is out of stock then there will be a promt alerting the user to that fact. Once the transaction is finished the product previously selected stock will go down to match how much was "bought".
